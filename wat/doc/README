TODO: change primary download link with a consistent one and add some mirror links

HOW TO UPDATE
===============
GIT clone is always recommended more than checking from the framework which is
good for new modules updates and slight changes in the framework itself.

For the GIT updates use:

git clone https://mrnfrancesco@bitbucket.org/mrnfrancesco/wat-framework.git wat-framework
OR
git clone git@bitbucket.org:mrnfrancesco/wat-framework.git wat-framework

For the "from-framework" updates use:

watf.py update


OTHER INTERFACES
================
There are no known user interfaces, but you could write your own and publish it
to make it the official one.
Give a look at doc/CONTRIBUTE to know how you can contribute to make
WAT Framework better and better.

GENERAL NOTE
============
Result files are saved as TARGET-joexploit.htm or TARGET-joexploit.txt
under report/ directory of joomscan.pl .

You're recommended to check updates once a month at least.

WAT Framework is not perfect. You're requested to post any issues/bugs/advices.
Give a look at doc/CONTRIBUTE to know how to do it.

I included my modules in the framework.
I'm sure there are thousands more implementable out there.
So when you're free, code some modules and let the community know your nice finds.

Finally, full disclosure is the only way to stop the hole or worsen the world.
